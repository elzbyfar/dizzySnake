# Dizzy Snake

A modern spin on the classic arcade game. 

## Getting Started

After downloading or cloning this repository, open the 'snake.html' file in your browser. The game should start automatically. Gameplay uses the the 4 directional keys. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. 

## Prerequisites

The latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Goals

   * Enable Fruit counter
   * Incorporate a little "wall" space along the edges. These should be small blocking points through which the snake cannot go.
   * Disable reverse. Snake should not be able to go in the exact opposite direction that it's coming from. 
   * Disable any contact between the snake head and its body. 
   * 3 "life" system: 
        * Each piece of fruit is set to a timer. The snake should reach that fruit before the timer for that piece expires. If the snake cannot reach the fruit within that time, that piece goes away and a life is removed. The snake can retain its length and a new piece of fruit appears with a brand new timer. 
        * A extra life can be gained for every 10 pieces of fruit consumed. 
        * Crashing into your own body loses a life. Snake retains its length but regenerates at upper left corner or screen. 
   * Photo (png files) should replace fruit.
